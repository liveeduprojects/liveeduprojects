### <span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the project about?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">We are going to teach you how to develop real games with basic coding skills. We will demonstrate to you how you can use free software to build your very own cross-platform video games. Intended as a beginner level tutorial, you will create your own version of the popular game “Flappy Bird.”</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">What next? Space Shooter! Stay following us after this program! In each video series, we are going to show you how to create a different game from the ground up, which means you can expand on what you have already learned.</span>

**What You will Learn**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this project, you are going to learn some very important concepts in the world of game development, including how to create;</span>

*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Your own graphics.</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Your game audio.</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Every line of code focused around C# and Unity3D.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the course is focused on Windows, it allows you to create a cross-platform game compatible with over 20 platforms, including the Web, Android, Mac OS X, and iOS.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The best part is that if you get stuck, you can download the source code and project files for each part of the video series for project comparison or better yet, ask for assistance during our live sessions.
