<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you are looking for a guy who is inspired by “Ants,” then you finally have the chance to do so. Meet </span>**_Foamy125_**<span style="font-weight: 400;">, a self-taught engineer who likes the Ant’s world and Lisp. He loves the neural network, genetic algorithms and loves talking to Janitor. Currently, he has 54 followers and has streamed 178 hours in total. He loves to build games and has four years of experience.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The project that he will work on is“</span>[**_How to create a city builder game._**](https://www.liveedu.tv/foamy125/RG6jE-how-to-create-a-city-builder-game/)<span style="font-weight: 400;">” This project is in </span>**TEACHING**<span style="font-weight: 400;"> mode. It is a live and real-world project. This means that you can interact with the streamer and communicate with them directly using chat. Got stuck? Just go ahead and ask him questions.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">What is the project about?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is about creating a city builder game using web technologies such as WebGL and JavaScript. Developing a complex game such as a city building game can give you a good learning experience in game development. To make it simple, the streamer will start with basic game concepts such as rendering a dot, making a random walk around the screen and so on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">After the basics are covered, the streamer will go forward and discuss complex ideas such as meta-heuristic algorithms for finding the traffic behavior, wealth distribution among citizens and so on.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Programming code will be covered in the tutorial. However, don’t expect every single line of code to be covered. Learners can easily download the source code for offline practice.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Along with pure JavaScript, </span>[<span style="font-weight: 400;">Sibilant</span>](https://sibilant.org/)<span style="font-weight: 400;"> will also be used for developing the game.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">For who is the project aimed at?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The project is aimed at learners who are eager to improve or expand their web development skills. To completely enjoy and learn at the same time, the viewer should have a basic understanding of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS in general. If you are a complete beginner, the course is not for you. You need to meet the basic requirement before you can start with the tutorial. Also, if you know any programming language at intermediate or complete understanding, you are good to go for the course.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Other things that you should know are as below:</span>

*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Intermediate and Advanced understanding of Object Oriented Programming.</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Fundamentals of Functional Programming</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">You know what a “method” is and how it works in different context.</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">You know how to map from one type to another</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a basic knowledge of Linear Algebra.</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">Basic understanding of Matrix</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The desire and willingness to learn is also needed.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">The target audience for the course is as below:</span>

*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">You like simulation games like SimCity, or Cities: Skylines.</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">You have an interest in concepts typically associated with the field of AI, such as Neural Networks, or Biologically Inspired Algorithms.</span>
*   <span style="font-weight: 400;">You like to think of applications separately from the code written to make them run.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">What will you be able to do after you finish the course?</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning the course is a great way to improve your game development skills. If you are into to game development but has a good programming base, you can also leverage the knowledge shared in the course. In the end, you will understand how city building games work.</span>

### <span style="font-weight: 400;">The Curriculum</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">(in the words of the streamer himself)</span>

**Session 1: Setting up, introduction to concepts**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will discuss what it is we will be doing, what exactly we will be creating together, and let you know a little about myself.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Then go over setting up the electron/node js environment, and make it work with a sibilant REPL (or any other compile to js dialect). This should be the same across all platforms; please let me know if it doesn’t work for you.</span>

**Session 2: Entities, Components, and Systems thereof.**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this session, I will describe the basics of an Entity component system (a common software architecture used in making games), and implement an entity that moves in a straight line.</span>

**Session 3: Collision, Fields, and entity detection.**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will describe what a field (from physics) is, and how it relates to many problems commonly encountered in game worlds, then we will implement an entity collision field.</span>

**Session 4: Random walks**

<span style="font-weight: 400;">I will describe what a random walk is, and how they relate to creating a city builder game, then we’re going to make an entity type which performs a random walk, and creates a basic environment which will pose a problem, which the entity will use a random walk to solve.</span>
